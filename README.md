# House Pricing
Study of the house pricing data-set from Kaggle.

I used multiple models such as XGBRegressor, Lasso, ElasticNet, LGBMRegressor. I also applied a stacking model to get better performance from our models.

The following plot shows a good represenation of the corrolation in the data. I find that the general living area and quality are the most corrolatied with the sale price. This makes sense the better the quality and the bigger the house is the more expensive it would be.

I also found that the newer houses tend to be more expensive then the old houses.
